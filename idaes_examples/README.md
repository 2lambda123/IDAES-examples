# Examples README

This file provides details about the internal organization of the example notebooks and supporting files.

## Directories
The examples are divided into a few top-level directories.
These directories are used to separate different purposes for the contained files:

* `docs`: Examples and tutorials that will be tested and also published in the online documentation.
* `int`: Examples and tutorials that will not be published in the online documentation.  
         This directory has two subdirectories:
    * `active`: Not published, but tested against new PRs
    * `archive`: Not published and *not* tested against new PRs
