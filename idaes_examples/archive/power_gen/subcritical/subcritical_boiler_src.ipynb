The boiler maintains circulation through the steam drum, downcomer, and waterwall by natural circulation. Natural circulation boilers rely on feedwater temperature and the resulting density differences in the drum and vertical tubes in the waterwall to promote circulation by gravity. See the ```supercritical_steam_cycle.py``` for more information on how to assemble the flowsheet.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates a simulation of a subcritical pulverized coal boiler - recirculation system only. \n",
    "```subcritical_boiler.py``` includes four modules (main, create_model, initialize and set_inputs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```main()``` function creates the Pyomo concrete model and calls for the other functions to build the flowsheet, set inputs, initialize each unit, and solve the flowsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```create_model()``` function imports three units from power plant library (drum, downcomer, and waterwall sections). \n",
    "Then, it builds two arcs one to connect the drum liquid outlet to the downcomer tube/pipe model, and the other to connect the downcomer outlet to the first section of the waterwall sections model (first from bottom up). The waterwall sections model consists of several tube models interconnected, where, the outlet of each section connects with the next section. Finally, the last section connects with the drum (water_steam_inlet). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the drum the water steam mixture is separated, and the vapor leaves the top of the drum (as steam outlet). The separation is calculated using the IAPWS95 steam properties. Feedwater enters the drum from the economizer. The steam leaving the ```drum``` is heated in the superheaters, using hot flue gases, before it passes to the high-pressure turbine inlet as main steam. At this point superheaters have not been included in this simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```initialize()``` function uses the initial guess to initialize the models. Each model at the time, and using the solution from the previous interconnected model. \n",
    "The ```set_inputs()``` function unfixes the inlet streams of the intermediate units and fixes the appropiate variables (feedwater_inlet flow_mol and enth_mol)."

    "As can be observed above, the feedwater flowrate and steam flowrate leaving the drum increase due to the increase of heat duty. The recirculation flowrate decreases slightly due to the increase of the friction force inside the waterwall tubes, which is caused by the increase in vapor fraction.\n",
    "The recirculation ratio, defined as the ratio of flowrate of water in the circuity to the flowrate of the feedwater, decreases as heat duty increases.\n",
    "Finally, the slag layer temperature increases as the heat duty increases. Total heat transfer resistance includes the contributions from the slag layer, tube metal, and convection of the fluid with the slag layer as the highest contributor. Thus, since the slag thickness is fixed, the total heat transfer resistance does not change much. Therefore, as the heat duty is increased, the temperature difference between the slag layer and fluid becomes larger, while the fluid temperature remains almost constant."
