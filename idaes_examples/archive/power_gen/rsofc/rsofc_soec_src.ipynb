    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "The figure above shows the process flow diagram of the rSOC (reversible solid oxide cell) plant in SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) mode. The plant consists of five major sections: the ASU (air separation unit), the SOEC power island, the CPU (CO2 purification unit), the HRSG (heat recovery steam generator) and steam cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SOEC mode, the rSOC operates by using steam as fuel to produce Hydrogen on its fuel side (cathode side), while air is used as sweep gas to remove diffused oxygen from its air side (anode side). To provide air to the air side of the rSOC, ambient air is compressed in an air blower and preheated via two preheaters to reach the required temperature to sweep through the air side. The oxygen rich air stream which exits the air side of the rSOC is used to preheat the fresh air feed in the first air preheater, subsequently it is split in a splitter and used to preheat oxygen from the ASU in the oxygen preheater and natural gas feed in the natural gas preheater. Finally, the oxygen rich air streams from both the oxygen and natural gas preheaters are sent to the HRSG where they are further cooled before release to the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flowsheet example provides an off-design model for the rSOC in SOEC mode for hydrogen production up to **5 kg/s** with 98% CO2 capture."
