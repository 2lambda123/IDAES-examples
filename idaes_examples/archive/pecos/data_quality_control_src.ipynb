    "# Simple Data Quality Control Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using plant data in process models, quality control and fault detection analysis is recommended to identify potential data issues (i.e., missing or corrupt data) and data points that are not suitable for the intended analysis (i.e., abnormal plant behavior). This notebook demonstrates basic quality control analysis using a small data set. The analysis is run using [Pecos](https://pecos.readthedocs.io).\n",

    "Pecos is an open-source Python package designed to monitor performance of time series data, subject to a series of quality control tests. The software includes methods to run quality control tests defined by the user and generate reports which include test results and graphics. The analysis also produces \"clean data\" which removes data points that failed quality control inspection."
