# IDAES Examples

This repository contains example Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate and  explain 
the  capabilities of the IDAES platform.

Below are basic instructions to install, view, and run the examples.

If you are a developer who wishes to modify or add new notebooks, please refer to the file *README-developer.md*.

## Installing

This repository can be installed with *pip*: **NOT WORKING YET**
```shell
pip install idaes_examples
```

## Browsing notebooks

Use the `idaesx gui` command to get a simple graphical UI that lets you browse and open notebooks (in a Jupyter server) for local execution.

## Building documentation locally

Run `idaesx build` from the repository root. This will take a while.
You may want to step out and enjoy a warm beverage.
